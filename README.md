# Remote_Control_Ceiling_Fan

Hello All,

This was the Reverse Engineering project of Remote Control Ceiling Fan.

The first version of the software was made using Arduino, after the successfull testing and to save cost of the IC we shift from Atmega IC to PIC IC.
Second Version was develop using PIC16f676 IC and after successfully tested on this IC and to save more money we choose PIC12 and also write a code for the clone version of the PIC IC.

You can find all code and tested samples during this project.
